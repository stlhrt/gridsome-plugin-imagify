# gridsome-plugin-imagify
Gridsome plugin converting image paths into Image objects.

## Why?
Using local images in `<g-image>` component w/o knowing upfront what images you will use, 
or using local images as properties declared as paths in content files is, at best awkward.

Couldn't find any elegant solution that would be easy to use and easy to look at.

## How?
